# dataviz-hub2-data
A collection of data used in Dataviz.Shef.

# How to use
To use any of these data, use urls from `raw.githubusercontent.com` rather than `github.com` to avoid CORS issues.

For an item located in the `/visualisation/example-folder/example-data.json`, the full path will be:

```sh
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/researchdata-sheffield/dataviz-hub2-data/main/visualisation/example-folder/example-data.json
```

If you want to find out the url for each file manually, you can go to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/researchdata-sheffield/dataviz-hub2-data) for this repository, then navigate and click the target file. Click the `Raw` button on the top right and it will lead you to the raw content url.
